 - What are Promises in Node.js?
 
+Promises allow us to control asynchronous functions in node.js, just to avoid problems when we call functions in time. 
+Same as with callbacks, we need to be careful in placing or in nesting promises, to avoid situation similar to callbacks hell
+
 - What is callback hell?
 
+Callback hell is a problematic situation for programmers, wherein callbacks are nested or scattered in code or between files.
+
 - What tools can be used to assure consistent style?
 
+ In Node.js or in JavaScript we will use ESLint, which finds parts of code we need to correct or ESLint will correct mistakes by itself.
+  
 - What is REPL? What purpose it is used for?
 
+REPL is the type of program, which lets us work with code easily. 
+We can start, check or control what happens in our app. Libraries could be installed using REPL. Node.js is the REPL itself.
+
 - What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
 
+I think in practice it’s a pretty similar thing, but Asynchronous is a feature of the Node.js, which changes Synchronous JavaScript, 
+whereas non-blocking is the term of posspibility, where more than one callback can work at the same time. 
+
 - List types of Http requests supported by Node.js?
 
+In node.js we  have few types of requests . 
+First of all there are two main request: GET and POST.
+The last ones are  PATCH, DELATE and PUT.
+
 - Is Node.js entirely based on a single-thread?
 
+Node.js likely the javascript can be called single-threaded, but in fact both of them are multi-threaded using only two threads. 
+Important thing is node.js doesn’t support multi-threating . 
+To solve, let’s call it a problem, we can make some background processes, but this solution is using a lot of memory. 
+Second solution is to use something like the worker_threads module.
+
 - What is your favourite HTTP framework and why?
 
+Right now i'm very interested in Express, because it’s the part of the MERN stack, which seems convenient and it’s based on JavaScript
+
 - What is difference between JavaScript and Node.js?
 
+First and the most important thing JavaScript is the programming language, but Node.js is more like an environment based on Javascript.
+ Moreover node works only at V8 engine, whereas javascript additionally starts in engines as Spider Monkey or Chromium 
+ 
 - What is TypeScript? Do you use it? Why / why not?
 
+Typescript is the programming language, which is very similar to javascript, if we will copy the content of a .js file to a .ts file. 
+We have a big chance that the script will start perfectly.
+I didn’t use TypeScript because I'm still gaining experience in Javascript. 
+I think Typescript will be a very good expansion of my knowledge in the future, for the reason that it seems very useful, when we use a lot of code.
+
 - What are the key differences between regular and arrow functions?
 
+Arrow function has shorter code than regular function, second thing in the arrow function we don’t use the method name, 
+but we add => between the brackets
+
 - What is destructuring?
 
+Destructuring is the expression, which allows us to put values from the arrays or objects to different variables.
+
 - Explain the difference:
 ```ts
 const a: string = "hello";
 const a = "hello" as string;
 ```
+Both lines are similar at all and both do the same. 
+Difference between them is the first code is written in TypeScript, 
+but in the second one with the as operator we need to use JSX which is used in React.
+

 **Find out why, fix it and write report on why did it happen.**
 
+First of all the problem was with the models/index.js
+
+; sign was making error, but after fix the API still wasn't work good.
+
+Second problem was with the models/users.js and ./routes/users.js instead of the id = 1 we had id = 0
+
+After the fix when i trying to get user/"anything.except.1" was working perfectyl, but in user/1 insted of the user data we get null, 
+because require function in routes/user.js always takes index.js file frist from the path we choose "./modules/ "
+I delated get:id function and replace it with the const users = require ('./users.js'), 
+then ./routes/users.js takes id data from ./modules/user.js throught ./modules/index.js. require .
+After fixes API works perfectly
